One of those newcomers was Jessica Stocker and she had joined the rest of the cast searching for love in all forms.</p><p>Now, let us tell you all about her in this writing called ‘Jessica Stocker Bio’.</p><h3><strong>Jessica Stocker On Winter House</strong></h3><p>Season 2 of the Bravo reality show spinoff, Winter House like old times and like Summer House, sees couples and hopeful romantics spending two weeks on vacation at a winter rental home in Vermont.</p><p>As for Jessica, unlike many of the Season 2 cast members, she had not appeared on any reality shows before this one. Also, she is a first-timer on the show just like Rachel Clark and <a href=#>Kory Keefer</a>.</p><p>“I’ve always been very sexually curious,” she can be heard saying during her first look at the show. Jessica then also made it clear that she is not afraid to branch out from hetero norms to make a connection during her stay.</p><p>So how did she land on the show? Jessica answered that she got an invite from Winter House Season 1 veteran<a href=#> Jason Cameron</a>. She explained how Jason messaged her on IG. While she thought it was probably just a pickup line, he was asking about the metaverse. And because she works in the metaverse, he was interested in the crypto space.</p><p>Jack himself also returned to the show to find love again. The Season 1 of the show had mostly seen his tumultuous relationship troubles.</p><h3><strong>Is Jessica Stocker Dating Anyone?</strong></h3><p>So, after Jason slid into her DM’s, Jessica Stocker was excited to join the Winter House and show off her wild side to a completely new group of friends. Just then, Bravo also promised us that while Jessica’s party-girl behavior gets her into hot water with some of her housemates, they will see to it that she also explores a romance that has the potential to last beyond the winter vacation.</p><p>Judging from this only, Jessica should have been single at the time when she decided to take part in this show. But, if or not she really fell in love there, it was not revealed.</p><h3><strong>Jessica Stocker Age</strong></h3><p>Born in 1997, Jessica Stocker reached the age of 25 in 2022.</p><h3><strong>Who Are Jessica Stocker’s Parents?</strong></h3><p>Jessica Stocker’s dad is Brian Ray Stocker. On his LinkedIn, he introduces himself literally as the owner of American coins and gold.</p><p>He turned 52 years old in October 2022 and by this time, he was still married to his wife/Jessica’s mum, Christi Joy Stocker.</p><p>Until 2022, the folks were based in&nbsp;Keizer city in Marion County, Oregon, and that same year in January, Christi turned 51 years old. Moreover, Christi is a teacher at Salem-Keizer Public Schools. And back in the day, she studied at Western Oregon University, George Fox University, and Sprague High School.</p><p>Jessica is not an only child born to her parents. Instead, she comes from a large family that comprises six siblings (including her). So, she has two sisters and three brothers, all very good-looking.</p><p>Among them, there is a sister, Nicole Stocker who was pursuing nursing at Salem Hospital as of 2022. A Salem, Oregon dweller, she is the former hostess/server/expo at McGrath’s Fish House as well as a former certified nurses aide from Prestige Post Acute Care & Rehab. What’s more, she studied at Western Oregon University and OHSU School of Nursing.</p><p>Also, there is Amber Joy Stocker, an alumnus of the University of Southern California.</p><h3><strong>Jessica Stocker Job</strong></h3><p>Jess is a Metaverse real estate agent, investor, and entrepreneur from Los Angeles.</p><p>As stated in her Bravo TV bio, she most sells real homes as part of her career, but then also deals in selling virtual real estate in the metaverse.</p><p>Jessica runs a real estate business with her partner/best friend Kinsey (on IG @kinsey with 3.6M followers). Together, they had been running Blondes Building Equity since May 2018. The two also ran a small YouTube channel where they offered insight into the real estate industry. They both teamed up to work under the famous&nbsp;Keller Williams Beverly Hills&nbsp;and never once felt contrite about it.</p><p>It is taking after her father’s passion for sales that Jessica cultivated her entrepreneurial skills by buying and flipping houses. Jessica was born into a thriving family business. So, at an early age, she realized her passion for sales and relationship building. She started her real estate career in the South Bay before she brought this voracity with her to join Beverly Hills’ top-rated real estate professionals.</p><h3><strong>Jessica Stocker Height</strong></h3><p>Beautiful Jessica stands 5 feet and 6 inches in height.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>How Much is Jessica Stocker’s Net Worth?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Jessica Stocker reportedly owned above 400 thousand dollars in net worth as of 2022.</p><p>In place of a ‘metaverse real-estate agent’, Jessica has said she would rather call herself a consultant. That involves her finding buyers and sellers and connecting them. She, insisted, that she did not market anyone’s land or list it for them because there is not really a platform to do that when it comes to the metaverse.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Is Jessica Stocker On Instagram?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Jessica Stocker could be found on Instagram <a href=#>@jessicastocker_</a> with 117 posts and 34.5K followers as of 16 October 2022.</p><p>The metaverse queen also regularly updated her 22.3K followers on TikTok (@jessica.stocker).</p><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Jessica Stocker’s Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Jessica Stocker’s birthday is on March 16th and that makes her a Pisces.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Jessica Stocker From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Jessica Stocker hails from a small town in Salem, Oregon that is set amid a park with gardens.
