Karrueche has Vietnamese ancestors on her mother’s side and African-American ancestors on her father’s side. Karrueche attended Fairfax High School before transferring to Birmingham High School, where she matriculated in 2006. However, she chose not to advance her studies and instead focused on her passions, such as modeling.</p><h2><span id=Karrueche_Tran-_Relationship_Boyfriend>Karrueche Tran- Relationship, Boyfriend</span></h2><p>Karrueche and Brown began dating in 2010 but split up in 2013 after Brown rekindled his romance with Rihanna. However, because Rihanna and Brown’s romance did not continue, they reconnected in the same year. Unfortunately, the pair split up again, this time for real, after Tran discovered Brown has a daughter, Royalty. She then sought and was granted a restraining order against the singer in February 2017. Karrueche has been photographed with various other men since her and Brown’s breakup, including basketball players John Wall and James Harden, and she was also in a relationship with soccer player Memphis Depay.</p><h2><span id=Karrueche_Tran-_Professional_Career>Karrueche Tran- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Tran began her career in retail as a personal shopper at Nordstrom in Canoga Park, California’s Westfield Topanga Mall, assisting consumers in selecting what was best for them. After three years, she moved to Hollywood to work as a celebrity stylist, but her name quickly became well-known due to her romantic engagement with Chris Brown. She then began modeling for a variety of well-known brands, most notably as the face of Lady Crooks in 2013. Her career was steadily progressing, and she soon had the opportunity to try her hand at acting.</p><h2><span id=Ascension_to_prominence>Ascension to prominence</span></h2><p>When her relationship with Brown became public in 2010, her name began to appear in magazines, and her face appeared on the covers of those magazines. She was gradually garnering notice, which led to an opportunity to become an actress; Tran was cast as Vivian Johnson in the TV series “The Bay,” starring Kristos Andrews, Mary Beth Evans, and Derrel Whitt, and subsequently appeared in 44 episodes of the award-winning series between 2010 and 2017. Her acting career gradually took off, and fresh roles were presented to this young prodigy. She starred in the television horror thriller “The Fright Night Files” in 2014, and subsequently in the comedy film “A Weekend with the Family,” alongside Marques Houston and Wendy Raquel Robinson. She also had a small part in the action-comedy picture “The Nice Guys,” which starred Ryan Gosling, Russell Crowe, and Angourie Rice.</p><h3><span id=Consistent_Success>Consistent Success</span></h3><p>Karrueche played Chloe in the film “Only for One Night,” then Besh in the sci-fi horror picture “Welcome to Willits,” both starring Bill Sage and Chris Zylka.
