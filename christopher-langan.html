person. Are they examining a test tube? Gazing at a chalkboard full of complex equations? Giving orders in a boardroom? None of these descriptions fit Christopher Langan, who some consider the world’s smartest person alive.</p><p>Born into poverty, Chris Langan demonstrated high intelligence from a young age. In fact, he has one of the highest IQs ever recorded, somewhere between 190 and 210. But Langan doesn’t spend his days teaching on Ivy League campuses or overseeing national laboratories. Instead, the “smartest man in the world” lives a quiet life as a horse rancher.</p><h2>Chris Langan’s Rough Childhood Before He Became The “Smartest Man Alive”</h2><p>Born on March 25, 1952, Christopher Michael Langan showed signs of above-average intelligence from a young age. He could speak at six months and read at three years old. By the time he’d turned five, Langan had even started wondering about the existence of God.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-356967 alt="Christopher Langan" width=900 height=687 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/christopher-michael-langan.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-356967 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Darien Long/Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Christopher Langan with his grandfather in the 1950s.</span></p><p>“It was simply recognized that I was some kind of kid genius,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Langan said</a>. “My schoolmates saw me as the teacher’s pet, this little freak.”</p><p>But abuse permeated Chris Langan’s early years. His mother’s boyfriend, Jack, regularly beat him and his two half-brothers, although he denies the abuse.</p><p>“Living with him was like ten years of boot camp,” Langan recalled, “only at boot camp you don’t get the s**t beaten out of you every day with a garrison belt, and in boot camp, you’re not living in abject poverty.”</p><p>Chris Langan’s family was incredibly poor, leaving him and his brother to fend for themselves in many cases.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-493429 alt="Smartest Man Alive" width=500 height=374 data-sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/smartest-man-alive.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-493429 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Flickr</span><span class=caption-body>With a reported IQ between 195 and 210, Chris Langan might be the smartest person in the world despite being a college dropout who works as a rancher.</span></p><p>“To this day, I have not met anyone who suffered in their childhood from poverty like my family suffered. We didn’t have a pair of equal socks, but holes in the shoes. And in the pants. We always wore the same clothes. I remember with my brothers washing our only clothes in the bathtub: we did it naked because we had nothing else to wear,” Langan <a href=# rel=noopener>stated</a>.</p><h2>His Astonishing Intelligence Begins To Shine Through</h2><p>Despite such adversity, Chris Langan continued to excel academically. By the time he was 12, he had learned all his public school could teach him and started spending time in independent study. Even then, he was showing signs that he might one day become the “smartest person in the world.”</p><p>“Taught myself advanced math, physics, philosophy, Latin and Greek, all that,” Langan, who could learn a language by simply skimming through a textbook, recalled. He even got a perfect score on the SAT, even though he’d fallen asleep during the test.</p><p>He also started working out. And when Jack tried to attack him one morning when he was 14, Langan fought back — effectively throwing Jack out of the house for good.</p><p>Soon, Christopher Langan prepared to go to college. But he’d soon find that intelligence didn’t always translate into real-world success for the alleged smartest person in the world.</p><h2>Christopher Langan Drops Out Of College And Starts Taking Odd Jobs</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-493428 alt="Christopher Langan Smartest Person Alive" width=800 height=649 data-sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/christopher-langan-smartest-person-alive.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-493428 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>Chris Langan and his wife, Gina, in 2017.</span></p><p>Christopher Langan went to Reed College hoping to study math and philosophy. But when his mother failed to sign a form securing him a full scholarship, he dropped out.</p><p>He next went to Montana State, but only briefly. Langan later said that he’d clashed with a math professor and had car troubles that made it impossible to get to class.</p><p>“There I was, paying my own money, taking classes from people who were obviously my intellectual inferiors. I just figured, Hey, I need this like a moose needs a hat rack!” Langa said, according to an Esquire interview. “I could literally teach these people more than they could teach me… to this day, I have no respect for academics. I call them acadummies.”</p><p>Instead, he drifted east. Christopher Langan worked as a cowboy, a construction worker, a forest service firefighter, a fitness trainer, and a bouncer. By the time he was in his 40s, he was making just $6,000 a year.</p><p>“On one side, you’re a regular guy,” he stated to Esquire. “You go to work, you do your job, you exchange pleasantries. On the other side, you come home and you begin doing equations in your head. You kind of retreat into your own world–you make it work for you the best you can.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-356966 alt="Christopher Langan The Smartest Man Alive" width=600 height=910 data-sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/christopher-langan.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-356966 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Pinerest</span><span class=caption-body>Chris Langan, the “smartest man alive,” used his brawn and not his brains as a bouncer.</span></p><p>But the mind of the “smartest person in the world” kept on working. In his free time, Christopher Langan tried to untangle the secrets of the universe by developing a “theory of everything.” He calls it the Cognition-Theoretic Model of the Universe, or CTMU for short.</p><p>“It includes physics and the natural sciences, but it also goes to a level above. A level on which you can talk about the entirety of science,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Langan explained</a>, noting that CTMU could prove the existence of God.</p><p>However, the “smartest man in the world” doubts it’ll ever be read, published, or taken seriously. He thinks his lack of academic credentials will continue to hinder him.</p><h2>Christopher Langan’s Life As The World’s “Smartest Person Alive”</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-493363 alt="Chris And Gina Langan" width=900 height=675 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/langan-and-gina.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-493363 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>KTVO-Louis Finley</span><span class=caption-body>Chris Langan and his wife, Gina.</span></p><p>Though a 20/20 investigation found that Christopher Langan had an IQ between 195 and 210 (the average IQ is around 100), which would give him one of the <a href=# rel=noopener>highest IQs in the world</a>, the “smartest man in the world” continued to live a quiet life.</p><p>Today, he and his wife spend their days on a horse ranch in Mercer, Missouri. “Nobody knows anything about my IQ because I don’t tell them,” Langan explained.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-356968 alt="Chris Langan The Smartest Person In The World" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/chris-langan-missouri.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-356968 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>YouTube</span><span class=caption-body>Christopher Langan, the “smartest man in the world,” in Mercer, Missouri.</span></p><p>But he has kept his mind — and the minds of others — active. Christopher Langan and his wife founded the Mega Foundation in 1999, a nonprofit for people with high IQs to share ideas outside of academia.</p><p>He’s also courted some controversy. Langan is a 9/11 truther (he thinks the attacks were staged to distract from CTMU) and he believes in white replacement theory. An article in the <a href=# rel=noopener>Baffler called him</a> “Alex Jones with a thesaurus.”</p><p>As for Christopher Langan himself? How does he see his own, immense intelligence? For him, it’s like anything in life — we all have good luck and bad, and the “smartest person in the world” just happened to be endowed with a great mind.</p><p>“Sometimes I wonder what it would have been like to be ordinary,” he admitted. “Not that I’d trade. I just wonder sometimes.”</p><p>After reading about Christopher Langan, the smartest person in the world, learn about <a href=#>William James Sidis</a> and <a href=#>Marilyn vos Savant</a>, who had even higher IQs. Or, see how <a href=#>Albert Einstein’s brain</a> was stolen after his death.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyktNGiqq2noJ2ys3nLmqWgmZ4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jutta-leerdam-6-htm.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jutta Leerdam (speedskater) - Wikipedia, Age, Net Worth, Biography , Spotify, TikTok, Facebook, Fact</a>
