She is not only an amazing actress, but she is also an amazing wife to her devoted husband.</strong></p><p><strong>What is life like for the ‘Napoleon Dynamite’ star and her husband after more than two decades of marriage?</strong></p><h2>Shondrella Avery’s Husband</h2><p>In the early 2000s, Shondrella married her spouse, Ade Kester. Every year on August 29th, they celebrate their wedding anniversary. The pair married in front of their loved ones.</p><p>They exchanged vows, promising to never leave each other’s side till death parted them. They have spent more than two decades together and have thus far proven their vows to be true.</p><p>Hopefully, they will continue to adore each other as much as they have done up to this point. Avery even wrote an Instagram post in 2021 wishing her marriage a good anniversary.</p><p>She feels that their love will remain indefinitely. Ade, Shondrella’s husband, is a Nigerian who adores her as much as she adores him. They’ve been together for over two decades, and their love never seems to diminish.</p><p>Shondrella adores her spouse and has done so since the beginning. Ade will very definitely return her affections. Even when she first set out for Africa, she began in Ade’s native country of Nigeria.</p><p>She was, of course, more than welcome there. Despite their two decades of marriage, the couple has yet to have children. They are too preoccupied with their various occupations to devote time to raising children.</p><p>Shondrella and her boyfriend are probably too busy to take such a large move because having a child is a huge responsibility. Despite not having children, Shondrella adores children and would make an excellent mother in the future.</p><p>However, Shondrella and Ade have yet to discuss having children and expanding their family. Maybe they’re already satisfied with each other?</p><p>We just never know.</p><p>People have been inquiring if she is still working in the entertainment world and has a happy marriage. They also thought that she had maybe retired.</p><p>However, the truth behind such theories remains unknown to followers. Don’t worry, Shondrella fans; she hasn’t resigned from the entertainment world.</p><p>She, on the other hand, is as busy as ever. Although we can no longer see her on-screen displaying her looks and talents, she is hard at work off-screen, making the most of her talent.</p><p>Recently, in 2021, she Co-Executive Produced the True Story of Bob Zellner, a KKK Grandson turned Civil Rights Activist, directed by Barry Alexander Brown, with Executive Producer Frank Barwah and Oscar Winner Spike Lee.</p><p>Even as a producer, she is having a successful career in the entertainment world. Furthermore, she has her sweetheart by her side to support her at all times.</p><p>Not only that, but she has cultivated such a large and devoted fanbase that they will never abandon her. They will, of course, continue to support her in whatever she chooses to do with her career.</p><p>Shondrella is now pursuing her career with her adoring hubby by her side and followers cheering her on.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
