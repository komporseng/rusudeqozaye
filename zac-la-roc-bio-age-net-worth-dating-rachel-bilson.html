Her rumored boyfriend, Zac, and the </span><i><span>O.C.</span></i><span> alum were previously spotted packing on PDA in Malibu, CA, four months prior to the news.</span></p><p><span>So, who’s the charmer rumored to be dating Rachel? Keep reading this Zac La Roc Bio to learn all about him.</span></p><h3><b>Is Zac La Roc Dating Rachel Bilson?</b></h3><p><span>As of September 2022, it wasn’t confirmed if Zac La Roc was dating Rachel Bilson. However, all indicators pointed toward him.</span></p><p><span>On the </span><i><span>Call Her Daddy</span></i><span> podcast hosted by Alex Cooper, Rachel was asked, “Are you currently single” to which the actress replied, “I am not.” Cooper then jokingly inquired, “Is he bringing you coffee in the morning? Is he bringing you missionary (sex)?” To which, Rachel responded ardently, “F*ck yeah!”</span></p><p><span>Though the </span><i><span>O.C.</span></i><span> alum didn’t identify her boyfriend (at the time), the last person Rachel mingled with was Zac La Roc. The duo was first publicly spotted on May 23, 2022, relaxing at the beach on Monday afternoon in Malibu, CA. Upon digging, we found the pair might have been together for quite a while then. Well, at least since October 2021.</span></p><p><span>Prior to Zac, the actress dated the comedian Bill Hader for only a few months in the fall of 2019. But Rachel only opened up about their breakup in June 2022 — stating going through a breakup amid the coronavirus lockdown “was probably the hardest thing (she) ever done⁠, harder than childbirth!”</span></p><p><span>Also, before Bill, Rachel was caught flirting with a former Bachelor Nick Viall and they even went to dinner in October 2019. But the actress later shut down the speculations saying, “We’ve always just been friends. He’s a really nice guy.”</span></p><p><span>As for Rachel’s longest relationship, it was with Hayden Christensen — dating on and off for 10 years. Their chapter finally closed for good in 2017.
