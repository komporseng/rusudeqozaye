He understands things differently, and this helps him solve tough cases with the GBI. Even though he faced many challenges growing up, Will uses his experiences to help him in his job.</p><p>During Season 1 of the show, Will and his team work on solving different crimes. They tackle cases like catching a serial killer, rescuing someone who was kidnapped, and figuring out what happened in a mass shooting. These are really hard cases, but Will and his team are up to the challenge.</p><p>But it’s not just about the cases for Will. He also has his struggles to deal with.
