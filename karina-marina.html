She was born on <strong>October 30, 2007.</strong> She was born in Spain. Therefore, she is of Spanish nationality. Similarly, she is born to her parents Jose( Father) and Myla (Mother). Her mother is originally from Bulgaria. Therefore, she is of mixed ethnicity. Her birth sign is Scorpio. She doesn’t have any siblings.</p><p>Other than the above-mentioned details nothing more is known about her family background. It seems like the <strong>16-year-old</strong> YouTube star prefers to maintain her privacy regardless of her success on various social media platforms. Moreover, she is a dancer who has been passionate about dancing and gymnastics since the age of 5.</p><a href=#><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-100011 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KarinaMarina-Childhood.jpg alt="Karina & Marina" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p id=caption-attachment-100011 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Karina stretching while practicing gymnastics.

She probably studied in a school in her hometown. However, no information about her school is obtainable as of now. Neither Karina nor anyone from her family has disclosed the name of her school. It looks as if they are trying to protect their privacy which is understandable.</p><h2><span id=Professional_life>Professional life</span></h2><p>Karina & Marina’s YouTube channel was first created in April of 2017. As of the present, she has posted 358 videos on her channel. That is a lot of videos. Similarly, she has garnered 3.62 million followers on her YouTube channel. She is one of the most famous children’s Spanish YouTubers. Karina posts videos of her doing gymnastics, toy reviews, and other trendy and fun-to-watch videos on her channel. A factor that attracted such a huge audience to her videos particularly is her ‘imaginary twin sister; Marina’.</p><p>Karina in real life doesn’t have a twin sister. Marina on the other hand, who portrays the role of her twin sister in her videos is Karina herself. Marina is an imaginary person whom Karina brought to life through herself. It is quite impressive that such a young girl can be so creative with her video ideas. She does various challenges where it’s mostly Karina vs Marina. The Karina & Marina subscribers love her concepts. A few of her videos are quite popular not only in Spain but in different parts of the world. One of her videos has 36 million views, whereas another video of hers has 33 million views. It is truly remarkable that a 13-year-old girl, at such a young age, is making such videos and collecting several views on them.</p><a href=#><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-100012 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/KarinaMarina-career.jpg alt="Karina & Marina" width=650 height=365 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p id=caption-attachment-100012 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: A thumbnail of one of her videos.
